## Preliminary

You need [pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) to run the project. If you use our
Vagrant VM, please run the following command inside the VM:
```
pip install --user --break-system-packages pipenv
```
If you use our Docker container, please run the following command inside the container:
```
pip install --user pipenv
```

If you are using Windows as OS, you should use the PowerShell to install pipenv and
run the project.

## Installation

Install the project using pipenv in the directory where the `Pipfile` resides. The command

```
pipenv install
```

will create a virtual environment and install the required dependencies. Note that our Docker container only has
Python3.10 installed, however, you may also use this instead with the command
```
pipenv --python /usr/bin/python3 install
```
When using an IDE like PyCharm you want to make sure that that virtual environment is used for the project.

Then
```
pipenv shell
```
will activate that virtual environment.

After working on the project, the virtual environment can be deactivated again using the
```
exit
```
command.

## Unit Tests

To run the unit tests in the virtual environment, use the following command:

```
python manage.py test
```

Recall to disable the failing tests and enable them one by one to see the failing tests. 
Note that the tests use the fixture `database_dump.json`.

## Server

To run the server in the virtual environment, use the following command:
```
python manage.py runserver
```

If you are using our Vagrant VM or our Docker container, you need to explicitly specify the IP address and port:
```
python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
```

In both cases, you can access the server in a browser of your choice under http://127.0.0.1:8000/.

## Models, Database, and Fake Data

Use the script
```
recreate_models_and_data.sh
```
to recreate the migrations, database, fake data and fixtures.
